  abstract = {The purpose of software development is meeting both functional and non-functional requirements. In mobile device applications, non-functional requirements are more relevant due to the restrictions inherent to these devices. The performance of a mobile application affects user preference for use. In this article, we present a performance study of the approaches used to develop software for mobile devices for the two currently more commonly used operating systems: iOS and Android. The results obtained are analyzed, and conclusions supported by the tests carried out are drawn.},

@article{Automated tests for cross-platform mobile apps in multiple configurations,
  abstract = {Cross-platform apps stand out by their ability to run in various operating systems (OSs), such as Android, iOS, and Windows. Such apps are developed using popular frameworks for cross-platform app development such as Apache Cordova, Xamarin, and React Native. However, the mechanisms to automate their tests are not cross-platform and do not support multiple configurations. Hence, different test scripts have to be coded for each platform, yet there is no guarantee they will work in different configurations varying, e.g. platform, OS version, and hardware available. This study proposes mechanisms to produce automated tests for cross-platform mobile apps. In order to set up the tests to execute in multiple configurations, the authors’ approach adopts two reference devices: one running Android and other iOS. As both platforms have their own user interface (UI) XML representation, they also investigated six individual expression types and two combined strategies to locate UI elements. They have developed a prototype tool called cross-platform app test script recorder (x-PATeSCO) to support the proposed approach, as well as the eight locating strategies considered. They evaluated the approach with nine cross-platform mobile apps, comparing the locating strategies in six real devices.},

@article{Native Apps Vs. Mobile Web Apps,
  abstract = {The extensive growth and expansion of smartphones and tablets and therewith the use of mobile web applications that utilize HTML5 and related technologies are frequently discussed and debated in media as possible replacements for native applications. The aim of this study was to explore the viability of replacing native applications with mobile web applications in a developing country setting. Two mobile web applications were developed. The first mobile web application tracked runs and the second mobile web application was a booking system for scheduling â??slum runsâ?. The subjects who tested these apps were elite, semi-professional Kenyan runners primarily from the Kibera slum area outside of Nairobi. After a 6-month test period the participants concluded and results indicated that the mobile web application for tracking runs performed poorly compared to native applications due to poor GPS performance, while the mobile web application for booking slum runs performed well. The conclusion from this study is that mobile web applications that require hardware interaction such as using the GPS, GPU, or camera are not yet viable alternatives for native applications. However, mobile applications that only require a native interface and content consumption are suitable substitutes for native applications.},

@article{Review of Cross-Platforms for Mobile Learning Application Development,
  abstract = {Mobile learning management systems are very important for training purpose. But considering the present scenario, the learners are equipped with a number of mobile devices that run by different operating systems with diverse device features. Therefore, developing a mobile application for different platforms is a cumbersome task if appropriate tools and techniques are not practiced. There are three categories of mobile application namely native, web based and hybrid. For mobile learning system, hybrid is an appropriate choice. In order to avoid re-implementation of the same hybrid application for different platform separately, several tools are proposed for example: PhoneGap, Adobe Air, Sencha Touch and QT, each with their own strength. With proper use of the strength of individual framework or the combination of frameworks, more compatible and more stable, cross-platform mobile learning application specifically for quizzes and assignments can be developed.},

The evolution of this new paradigm has taken the attention of researchers and companies as viable alternative to the mobile development. This paper shows how hybrid development can be an alternative for companies provide their services with a low investment and still offer a great service to their clients.},

@article{Cross-platform mobile development approaches,
  abstract = {The diversity of platforms on the smart phones market, make the mobile applications development quite difficult and very expensive. Platform development could be a good solution for this problem. We'll start by defining cross-platform development, and define the different types of mobile applications, and then define and explain the different approaches used in cross-platform development in order to achieve a comparison between these approaches allowing us to identify the strong points, and weaknesses of each approach. We present our results in a comparative table taking into consideration several criteria. These benchmarks have shown that the choice of a cross-platform development approach depends mainly on two things: to know what type of mobile application should be directed, and or targeted platforms. And adding the fact that multiplatform tools based on these approaches are limited in some point (access to different API platforms, performance compared to native applications ...), this work shows with certainty that more research is needed to go further than the current approaches.},

@article{A comparative analysis of cross-platform development approaches for mobile applications,
  abstract = {Nowadays, native mobile applications (mobile apps) are targeted at specific mobile platforms. This phenomenon imposes severe constraints, such as the use of different development environments, technologies, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for each mobile platform, leading inevitably to a waste of development time and effort, and an increased maintenance cost. The paper focuses on the current trends in developing cross-platform mobile apps. Our analysis focuses primarily on three areas. In the first place, we clarify the cross-platform development landscape by exploring the most important cross-platform app types, which are web, hybrid, interpreted and generated apps. Secondly, key issues for each app type are presented and a comparative analysis is performed to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each type. Thirdly, taking into account the current status in cross-platform mobile app development we identify a promising cross-platform app type and we investigate its effectiveness in practice. Finally, we draw some conclusions regarding cross-platform mobile app development approaches and make proposals for further research on the field.},
